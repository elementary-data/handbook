Elementary was founded by Maayan and Or in August of 2021.

We are long time friends who met through Or's wife - who worked with Maayan. After ruining too many double dates with talks about startups, data, and engineering, we decided to start a company together.

It quickly became clear to us that we wanted to solve a problem we had experienced first hand. We also aimed to focus on a field where we felt that we have strong founders-market fit. Our shared background and strengths are in software development, data, and security.

We brainstormed around pains we experienced in our careers. At some point, we realized that while working with data in entirely different environments, we both experienced similar frustrating pains around data reliability.

In software development and DevOps there are tools and methods to achieve reliability. In cyber security, building visibility and detecting anomalies as early as possible is critical. We figured we could apply the knowledge and expertise we have from these domains to solving data reliability at scale.

At this point, we simply talked to as many data professionals as we could find. People we worked with, friends of friends, and mostly tons of cold reach outs. We talked to around 70 teams in a few weeks. We wanted to learn if they trust their data. Do they have visibility and detection? What do they do about it? What solutions have they used or considered? We also asked about how they work, what they care about, and how they adopt new technologies.

The more talks we had, the more clear it became - if we were data or analytics engineers, there is no solution we would have been happy to use. One you can deploy in minutes, easily configure and extend to fit your needs, and integrate with your existing workflow.

We decided to build it.
